# Introduction
This project is made using PIC microcontroller and performs all the necessary functions that a microwave does like micro, grill, convection etc. 

# Requirements 
Microwave Oven Simulator project is made using PIC microcontroller - PIC16F877A To execute this mainly 3 softwares are required for the coding and the simulation part which are: MPLAB X IDE, XC8 compiler and PICSimLab.

# Installation

1. Using [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvO2IBhCzARIsALw3ASpGLTql48KbkHFrHpiD5FIr3GGTePNZNGu0uS3KR4fX1jLg8zOY_4EaArDFEALw_wcB) this link you can download the required software.

2. Using [XC8](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers#tabs) this link you can download the compiler.

Both the above 2 softwares are used to execute the code.

3. Using [PICSimLab](https://sourceforge.net/projects/picsim/) this link you can download the simulator to run the code.
